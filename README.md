# Say It!
Say It! is an Android App aimed to help people with their English Pronunciation.
We're three Italian students trying to bring something new to people.

# Welcome to Say It!

We're bringing you the best app to improve your English Pronunciation. We always asked ourselves, as non-native speakers, how to improve our Pronunciation Skill in Both American and British English.

How to do that? Practicing! **Practicing** is the best and the most natural way to improve your language skills.

Don't waste your time searching for ways to improve your skills, just do it!

**Say It! will allow you to:**
- *Listen to the correct pronunciation of a word (thanks to Google's Synthesizer) in Both American and British English*
- *Read the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) of the word you're looking for*
- *Record your pronunciation and compare it to the original one*
- *Add to your favorite list the word you need to practice the most so you can easily retrieve it every day*
- *Don't know which word you should practice? Practice our Word of the Day!*
- *And many other features...*
